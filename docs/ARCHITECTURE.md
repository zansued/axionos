## 1. Project Overview

**AxionOS** is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that operates as an autonomous software engineering system. It orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate complete production-ready applications through a deterministic 32-stage pipeline with self-healing builds, architecture simulation, and preventive validation.

### What AxionOS Is Today

An autonomous engineering platform with commercial readiness and active learning:
- A 32-stage deterministic pipeline from idea to deployable application
- A Project Brain (knowledge graph with semantic search)
- An AI Efficiency Layer (prompt compression, semantic cache, model routing)
- Self-healing build repair with CI integration
- DAG-based parallel execution with 6 concurrent workers
- Evidence-oriented repair with adaptive routing
- Preventive engineering with active prevention rules
- Commercial readiness: product plans, billing, usage enforcement
- Learning Agents v1: rule-based, auditable prompt and strategy optimization
- Agent OS v1.0 — a 14-module runtime architecture across 5 planes

### System Maturity

| Level | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Level 1 | Code Generator | ✅ |
| Level 2 | Software Builder | ✅ |
| Level 3 | Autonomous Engineering System | ✅ Complete |
| Level 4 | Self-Learning Software Factory | 🔄 Entering |
| Level 5 | Autonomous Startup Factory | 🔮 Long-term |

> **Current position:** Level 3 complete → Level 4 entering.
> **System state:** Commercial + Learning Platform.
> **Kernel status:** Stable and operational.
> **Learning status:** Active, rule-based, auditable.

### Implementation Horizons

| Horizon | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **NOW** | Kernel + Commercial + Learning v1 | ✅ 12 Sprints Complete |
| **NEXT** | Learning Agents Expansion + Meta-Agents | 📋 Planned |
| **LATER** | Product Intelligence Layer | 📋 Planned |
| **FUTURE** | Market Intelligence Layer | 📋 Planned |

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| State Management | TanStack React Query + React Context |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, RLS) |
| AI Engine | Lovable AI Gateway (Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro) + Efficiency Layer |
| Git Integration | GitHub API v3 (Tree API for atomic commits, PRs) |
| URL Scraping | Firecrawl (self-hosted or cloud) |
| Deployment | Vercel/Netlify configs auto-generated |

### Multi-Tenancy Model

- **Organizations** → **Workspaces** → **Initiatives**
- RLS policies enforce isolation per `organization_id`
- Role-based access: `owner`, `admin`, `editor`, `reviewer`, `viewer`
- Auto-provisioning: first login creates a default org via `create_organization_with_owner` RPC

---

## 2. Active Architecture Layers

AxionOS consists of seven active layers, each with clearly defined responsibilities and interaction boundaries.

### Layer 1: Kernel Execution Layer

**Purpose:** Execute the 32-stage deterministic pipeline with DAG-based parallel orchestration.

**Key modules:**
- `pipeline-bootstrap.ts` — Pipeline lifecycle initialization with usage enforcement
- `dependency-scheduler.ts` — Kahn's algorithm, wave computation, 6 workers
- `pipeline-execution-orchestrator` / `pipeline-execution-worker` — DAG agent swarm
- `pipeline-helpers.ts` — Standardized logging, jobs, messages
- 50+ Edge Functions covering all 32 stages

**Interactions:** Consumes governance decisions from Control layer. Produces execution data consumed by Observability and Learning layers.

### Layer 2: Validation and Repair Layer

**Purpose:** Validate generated code and autonomously repair build failures.

**Key modules:**
- `pipeline-validation` — AI-powered fix loop (3 iterations)
- `pipeline-deep-validation` — Deep static analysis
- `pipeline-drift-detection` — Architectural drift detection
- `pipeline-runtime-validation` — Real tsc + vite build via CI
- `autonomous-build-repair` — Self-healing builds from CI error logs
- `pipeline-fix-orchestrator` — Multi-iteration fix coordination

**Interactions:** Receives code from Kernel. Produces `repair_evidence` consumed by Learning layer.

### Layer 3: Prevention and Routing Layer

**Purpose:** Proactively prevent known failure patterns and route repair strategies based on evidence.

**Key modules:**
- `pipeline-preventive-validation` — Pre-generation guard
- `prevention-rule-engine` — Active prevention rule management
- `repair-routing-engine` — Adaptive strategy selection
- `error-pattern-library-engine` — Pattern extraction and indexing

**Persistence:** `active_prevention_rules`, `error_patterns`, `prevention_rule_candidates`, `repair_routing_log`

**Interactions:** Consumes patterns from error history. Feeds routing decisions to Repair layer. Learning layer adjusts routing weights.

### Layer 4: Governance and Audit Layer

**Purpose:** Enforce trust boundaries, approval workflows, SLA compliance, and complete audit trails.

**Key modules:**
- `governance.ts` — Approval workflows, access control
- `pipeline_gate_permissions` — Per-role stage access
- `stage_sla_configs` — SLA enforcement per stage
- `audit_logs` — Complete event ledger

**Interactions:** Gates pipeline advancement. All layers emit audit events.

### Layer 5: Observability Layer

**Purpose:** Track execution telemetry, cost, performance, and system health.

**Key modules:**
- `observability-engine` — Telemetry aggregation
- `initiative-observability-engine` — Per-initiative metrics
- Cost tracking per model, per stage, per initiative

**Persistence:** `initiative_observability`, `initiative_jobs` (cost_usd, tokens_used, duration_ms)

**Interactions:** Provides data consumed by Commercial layer (billing) and Learning layer (analysis).

### Layer 6: Commercial Readiness Layer (Sprint 11)

**Purpose:** Make AxionOS operationally packageable as a commercial product.

**Key modules:**
- `usage-limit-enforcer.ts` — Enforces plan limits at pipeline entry points
- `billing-calculator.ts` — Cost aggregation with org-safe job filtering
- `product-dashboard` — Overview, usage metrics API

**Persistence:**
- `product_plans` — Starter / Pro / Enterprise with numeric limits
- `billing_accounts` — Stripe-ready schema with billing period tracking
- `workspace_members` — Granular roles per workspace

**Hardening corrections applied:**
- Usage enforcement integrated into `pipeline-bootstrap.ts` and `run-initiative-pipeline`
- Cross-org query leakage fixed: all job aggregation scoped by organization initiatives
- Cost double-counting fixed: `job_cost` is the single source of truth

**Interactions:** Consumes observability data. Blocks pipeline execution when limits exceeded (HTTP 402, `USAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`).

### Layer 7: Learning Agents Layer (Sprint 12)

**Purpose:** Transform passive learning data into active, auditable intelligence.

**Key modules:**

| Module | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Prompt Outcome Analyzer | `prompt-outcome-analyzer/index.ts` | Aggregates success_rate, cost, retry_rate per stage+model signature |
| Strategy Performance Engine | `strategy-performance-engine/index.ts` | Evaluates repair strategy effectiveness with MTTR and recurrence |
| Predictive Error Engine | `predictive-error-engine/index.ts` | Detects recurring failure patterns, generates prevention candidates |
| Repair Learning Engine | `repair-learning-engine/index.ts` | Adjusts routing weights: `new_weight = prev + success_factor − failure_penalty` |
| Learning Recommendation Engine | `learning-recommendation-engine/index.ts` | Generates structured improvement recommendations |
| Learning Dashboard | `learning-dashboard/index.ts` | API: overview, recommendations, strategies, errors |

**Persistence:**
- `prompt_strategy_metrics` — Aggregated prompt performance
- `strategy_effectiveness_metrics` — Repair strategy effectiveness
- `predictive_error_patterns` — Recurring failure predictions
- `repair_strategy_weights` — Adjusted routing weights with audit trail
- `learning_recommendations` — Structured improvement suggestions

**Interactions:** Consumes data from Observability, Repair, and Prevention layers. Produces recommendations and weight adjustments. Cannot mutate Kernel, Governance, or Commercial layers.

### Learning Safety Principles

Learning in AxionOS follows this chain:

```
Observation → Evidence → Analysis → Recommendation → Human-safe Adjustment
```

**Rules:**
1. Learning is **additive** — new modules consume existing data, never modify kernel
2. Learning is **rule-based** — no black-box behavior, all logic explicit
3. Learning is **auditable** — all decisions logged as `LEARNING_UPDATE` events in `audit_logs`
4. Learning is **bounded** — weight adjustments have min/max constraints, are reversible
5. Learning **cannot mutate**: pipeline stages, governance rules, product plans, billing

## 3. Agent Operating System (Agent OS) — v1.0 GA

The Agent OS is the runtime architecture governing how agents are selected, executed, governed and coordinated. It consists of 14 modules organized into 5 architectural planes.

```
callAI() -> compress -> cache lookup -> route model -> LLM call -> cache store -> return
```

---

## 6. Stage Contracts

Every pipeline stage defines a formal contract specifying its interface with the orchestrator.

```
stage_contract {
  stage_name         -- unique identifier
  required_inputs    -- JSON schema of expected inputs
  produced_outputs   -- JSON schema of outputs
  external_deps      -- external services required
  side_effects       -- mutations outside initiative_jobs
  failure_modes      -- enumerated failure types
  retry_policy       -- { max_retries, backoff_strategy, idempotent }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented — enforced via `initiative_jobs` and `pipeline-helpers.ts`

---

## 7. Agent IO Contracts

All agents produce outputs conforming to this structure:

```
agent_output {
  summary           -- human-readable summary
  decisions[]       -- list of decisions made
  artifacts[]       -- generated files, schemas, or specifications
  confidence_score  -- 0.0-1.0 self-assessed confidence
  model_used        -- which LLM model was used
  tokens_used       -- token count for cost tracking
  duration_ms       -- execution time
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented — enforced via `pipeline-helpers.ts`

---

## 8. Five Fundamental Agent Types

| Agent Type | Responsibility | Example Modes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Perception Agent** | Interprets ideas, requirements, market signals, context | `idea_intake`, `requirement_analysis`, `market_signal` |
| **Design Agent** | Creates architecture, domain models, data models, API designs | `architecture`, `domain_modeling`, `data_modeling`, `api_design` |
| **Build Agent** | Generates code, UI, configs, migrations, artifacts | `business_logic`, `api_generation`, `ui_generation` |
| **Validation Agent** | Static analysis, runtime validation, QA, architectural checks | `static_analysis`, `runtime_build`, `drift_detection` |
| **Evolution Agent** | Repair, learning, pattern extraction, prompt optimization | `build_repair`, `error_learning`, `pattern_extraction` |

```
Agent Specialization = Mode + Tools + Memory + Contract
```
